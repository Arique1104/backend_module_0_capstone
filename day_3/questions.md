## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.
A conditional statement values true or false and is typically used in if statement methods.

Ex_1: num == 5

Ex_2: num && num1

Ex_3: num || num1

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

> If I want the computer to make a series of choices automatically without me getting in the way.

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

```
if variable_name == "set terms"
puts "Write your result"
end
```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

You use elsif for all of your conditions, and you use else for your last condition.


1. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

```
if variable_name == "set terms here"
  puts "Write your result"
elsif variable_name == "set different terms"
  puts "Write different result"
else variable_name (leave blank)
  puts "Write different result."
end
```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

> If I want to know if an element exists within an array, I can use conditional statements to find out.
